# BlazingTool

> [!TIP] 
> Brute force ethereum wallet mnemonics. Multi-threaded and suprisingly fast. automatically generate seed phrases and check balances for Ethereum networks. If a wallet with a non-zero balance is found, the wallet's information (address, mnemonic, private key, and balances) is logged and saved to a file named result.txt.
